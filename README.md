Go to problemset1/interpreter/interpreter.py

I realize I could've asked AI, but could you kindly clarify a few of my questions?

1. Does a variables size change depending on it's content?
2. Do functions use space the moment they are declared?
3. The problem could've been solved using if "+" in string. According to AI the "in" keyword is basically a function that iterates over an iterable (string, list, tuple, set, etc) and returns True as soon as the input is equal to element else False. Also according to AI, iterating over either a dictionary or a tuple has time complexity (O)1. Which approach is faster?
4. Which approach would you encourage and why?
5. In that program since the functions are lambda or anonymous, what does it mean? I remember during bootcamp, it was said they are used once and yet I can use them a lot.
6. I am trying another version of the interpreter that can accept input such as 1+1*3(2+1) to correctly output 10. Would you be interested in reviewing and advising?
7. Go to problemset3/fuel/fuel.py. I dare say it was required negative values, float and negative values were not allowed, why then should we have raised Errors? Isn't avoidance a better strategy than resistance?
